# Dinosaur-Game

- It is a simple Dino Game in C++ using **SFML**.
- I created this project with the goal of learning and practicing the **SFML** graphics library, as well as developing my skills in designing a simple game. This game has all the fundamental features of the original Chrome Dino game.
